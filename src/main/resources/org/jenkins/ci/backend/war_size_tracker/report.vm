h2. Why?

This page attempts to draw attention to historical [Jenkins WAR|http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/latest/] file sizes across releases. Please note that unless there was an actual bug which led to a size increase, which was later fixed, it is expected that this size will be always increasing. This is normal, and not in and of itself cause for alarm; it is a primary result of Jenkins' unrelenting commitment to backwards compatibility.

h2. Charts

To help visualize how disparate the required core versions are, here is a graph which depicts the total number of plugins at each required core version. The chart ranges on the x-axis from 1.300 to 1.500.

||Version||Size (bytes)||
#foreach( ${war} in ${wars} )|| $!{war.version} | $!{war.size} |
#end
